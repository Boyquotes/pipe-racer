# Editor Revamp

## Must Have Features

- multi-select
- map preview picture
- more environment/ambient options
- structures (like in gd)
- add pipes (both small to drive on and large to drive inside)
- solve runoff areas
- colorable track pieces
- lights
- junctions

## Nice to have

- shadow map baking
- more surfaces

## Current Problems

- the editor was made with the original track in mind. This greatly limits creativity and possibilities
- also the mindset was to have a track editor to create nice tracks; this isn't gonna work if you don't have an image of how the tracks should look like
- I want to redo the prefab generator
  - have road profiles
  - have angles
  - make all connections smooth (unless overwritten)
  - can maybe have non-90 degree rotations
  - adjust track width
- runoff areas are really hard to create

## Research

- gather some ideas, design styles, images of what type of tracks i want to have, and make the editor around those ideas

### My experience

- driving in unusual places always caught my attention
  - inside a volcano or a mountain
  - inside a mine on minecart tracks
  - on platforms high in the sky
- vegetation, nature's beauties can always spice up the track
- loops, wallrides and jumps are always cool 

### Re-Volt

- this game has a unique charm because all the cars are so small
